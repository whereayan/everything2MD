## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide for Human Clinical Trials (SDTMIG) Version 3.4 has been prepared by the Submissions Data Standards (SDS) team of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Like its predecessors, v3.4 is intended to guide the organization, structure, and format of standard clinical trial tabulation datasets submitted to a regulatory authority. Version 3.4 supersedes all prior versions of the SDTMIG.

The SDTMIG should be used in close concert with Version 2.0 of the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm), which describes the general conceptual model for representing clinical study data that is submitted to regulatory authorities and should be read prior to reading the SDTMIG. SDTMIG Version 3.4 provides specific domain models, assumptions, business rules, and examples for preparing standard tabulation datasets that are based on the SDTM.

This document is intended for companies and individuals involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical data that will be submitted to regulatory authorities.

### 1.2 Organization of this Document

This document is organized into the following sections:

- Section 1, Introduction, provides an overall introduction to the v3.4 models and describes changes from prior versions.
- Section 2, Fundamentals of the SDTM, recaps the basic concepts of the SDTM, and describes how this implementation guide should be used in concert with the SDTM.
- Section 3, Submitting Data in Standard Format, explains how to describe metadata for regulatory submissions, and how to assess conformance with the standards.
- Section 4, Assumptions for Domain Models, describes basic concepts, business rules, and assumptions that should be taken into consideration before applying the domain models.
- Section 5, Models for Special-purpose Domains, describes special-purpose domains, including Demographics, Comments, Subject Visits, and Subject Elements.
- Section 6, Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes, provides specific metadata models based on the 3 general observation classes, along with assumptions and example data.
- Section 7, Trial Design Model Datasets, describes domains for trial-level data, with assumptions and examples.
- Section 8, Representing Relationships and Data, describes how to represent relationships between separate domains, datasets, and/or records, and provides information to help sponsors determine where data belong in the SDTM.
- Section 9, Study References, provides structures for representing study-specific terminology used in subject data.
- Appendices provide additional background material and describe other supplemental material relevant to implementation.

### 1.3 Relationship to Prior CDISC Documents

This document, together with the SDTM, represents the most recent version of the CDISC submission data domain models. All updates are intended to be backward-compatible. The most significant changes since SDTMIG v3.3 include:

- Expanded the scope of the DA domain to include study products in addition to study drugs. See Section 6.3.1, Product Accountability.
- Grouped specimen-based lab domains (e.g., CP, GF, LB) in Sections 6.3.5.1-6.3.5.9 and added a generic specification for these domains. See Section 6.3.5, Specimen-based Findings Domains.
- Expanded the scope of the IS domain for assessments of antigen-induced humoral or cell-mediated immune response. Added 3 new variables (i.e., Binding Agent, Molecule Secreted by Cells, Test Operational Objective). See Section 6.3.5.5, Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments.
- Updated the LB domain specification to include the following 10 new variables: Test Condition, Binding Agent, Test Operational Objective, Result Scale, Result Type, Collected Summary Result Type, Lower Limit of Detection, Method Sensitivity, Point in Time Flag, and Planned Duration. See Section 6.3.5.6, Laboratory Test Results.
- Decommissioned the Morphology (MO) domain.
- Added Cell Phenotyping Findings (CP) and Genomics Findings (GF) domains. See Section 6.3.5.3, Cell Phenotype Findings (CP), and Section 6.3.5.4, Genomics Findings (GF).
- Copied in Biospecimen Events (BE), Biospecimen Findings (BS), and Related Specimens (RELSPEC) from the provisional SDTMIG-PGx v1.0 in preparation for its eventual retirement. See Section 6.2.2, Biospecimen Events (BE); Section 6.3.5.2, Biospecimen Findings (BS); and Section 8.8, Related Specimens (RELSPEC).
- Updated QRS specifications and assumptions. Also introduced subsections to separate assumptions and examples describing the RS Disease Response use case and the RS Clinical Classifications use case. See Section 6.3.9, Questionnaires, Ratings, and Scales (QRS) Domains (FT, QS, RS).
- Updated the Tumor/Lesion (TU and TR) domain assumptions to describe use of indicator questions, disease recurrence conventions, and modeling of location of interest. See Section 6.3.12, Tumor/Lesion Domains.
- Expanded the scope of the SC domain to support collection over time. See Section 6.3.10, Subject Characteristics.
- Updated guidance and examples for the FA domain. See Section 6.4, Findings About Events or Interventions.
- Corrected Core values for the following variables: DSDY, DSSTDY, LBSTREFC, MILOBXFL, and MIBLFL.
- Updated Controlled Terminology for applicable variables across all domains, if available.
- Removed Appendix C1, Trial Summary Codes.

A detailed list of changes between versions is provided in Appendix E, Revision History.

Version 3.1 was the first fully implementation-ready version of the CDISC submission data standards that was directly referenced by the US FDA for use in human clinical studies involving drug products. However, future improvements and enhancements will continue to be made as sponsors gain more experience submitting data in this format. Therefore, CDISC will be preparing regular updates to the implementation guide to provide corrections, clarifications, additional domain models, examples, business rules, and conventions for using the standard domain models. Because CDISC will produce further documentation for Controlled Terminology as separate publications, sponsors are encouraged to check the CDISC website (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled- terminology) frequently for additional information. See Section 4.3, Coding and Controlled Terminology Assumptions, for the most up-to-date information on applying Controlled Terminology.

### 1.4 How to Read this Implementation Guide

The SDTMIG is best read online, so the reader can benefit from the many hyperlinks to internal and external references. The following guidelines may be helpful in reading this document:

1. First, read the SDTM to gain a general understanding of SDTM concepts.
2. Next, read Sections 1-3 of this document to review the key concepts for preparing domains and submitting data to regulatory authorities. Refer to Appendix B, Glossary and Abbreviations, as necessary.
3. Read Section 4, Assumptions for Domain Models.
4. Review Section 5, Models for Special-purpose Domains, and Section 6, Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes, in detail, referring back to Section 4, Assumptions for Domain Models, as directed. See the implementation examples for each domain to gain an understanding of how to apply the domain models for specific types of data.
5. Read Section 7, Trial Design Model Datasets, to understand the fundamentals of the Trial Design Model and consider how to apply the concepts for typical protocols.
6. Review Section 8, Representing Relationships and Data, to learn advanced concepts of how to express relationships between datasets, records, and additional variables not specifically defined in the models.
7. Review Section 9, Study References, to learn about occasions when it is necessary to establish study-specific references that will be used in accordance with subject data.
8. Finally, review the appendices as appropriate. Appendix C, Controlled Terminology, in particular,describes how CDISC Terminology is centrally managed by the CDISC Controlled Terminology Team. Efforts are made at publication time to ensure all SDTMIG domain/dataset specification tables and/or examples reflect the latest CDISC Terminology; users, however, should refer to https://www.cancer.gov/research/resources/terminology/cdisc as the authoritative source of controlled terminology, as CDISC Controlled Terminology is updated on a quarterly basis.

This implementation guide covers most data collected in human clinical trials, but separate implementation guides provide information about certain data, and should be consulted when needed. The following guides are available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig:

- The SDTM Implementation Guide: Associated Persons (SDTMIG-AP) provides structures for representing data collected about persons who are not study subjects.
- The SDTM Implementation Guide for Medical Devices (SDTMIG-MD) provides structures for data about devices.
- Historically, the SDTM Implementation Guide for Pharmacogenomics/Genetics (SDTMIG-PGx) has provided structures for pharmacogenetic/genomic data and for data about biospecimens. Much of the content of the SDTMIG-PGx has been incorporated into and/or superseded by the SDTMIG v3.4.

#### 1.4.1 How to Read a Domain Specification

A domain specification table includes rows for all required and expected variables for a domain and for a set of permissible variables. The permissible variables do not include all the variables that are allowed for the domain; they are a set of variables that the SDS Team considered likely to be included. The columns of the table are:

- Variable Name

  - For variables that do not include a domain prefix, this name is taken directly from the SDTM.
  - For variables with a "--" placeholder in the SDTM, the "--" is replaced by the 2-character domain code.
- Variable Label: A longer name for the variable

  - This may be the same as the label in the SDTM, or it may be customized for the domain.
  - Sponsors should create an appropriate label if they include in a dataset an allowable variable not in the domain specification.
- Type: One of the 2 SAS datatypes, "Num" or "Char". These values are taken directly from the SDTM.
- Controlled Terms, Codelist, or Format

  - Controlled Terms

    - As noted in the table note, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology.

      - The controlled terminology might be of a type that would inherently be sponsor-defined.
      - The controlled terminology might be of a type that could be standardized, but for which a codelist not yet been developed.
      - The controlled terminology might be terminology specified in value-level metadata.
    - The name of an external code system (e.g., MedDRA) will be listed in plain text.
  - Codelist

    - A hyperlinked codelist name in parentheses indicates that the variable is subject to the CDISC Controlled Terminology in the named codelist.
    - Multiple hyperlinked codelist names indicate that the variable is subject to 1 or more of the named codelists from CDISC Controlled Terminology. If multiple codelists are in use for a single domain, value-level metadata would indicate where each codelist is applicable.
    - A hyperlinked codelist name and an asterisk (*) indicate that the variable is subject to either the named codelist from the CDISC Controlled Terminology or to an external dictionary. The specific dictionary is identified in the metadata.
  - Format: "ISO 8601 datetime or interval" or "ISO 8601 duration" in plain text indicates that the variable values should be formatted in conformance with that standard.
- Role: This is taken directly from the SDTM. Note that if a variable is either a Variable Qualifier or a Synonym Qualifier, the SDTM includes the qualified variable, but SDTMIG domain specifications do not.
- CDISC Notes may include any of the following:

  - A description of what the variable means
  - Information about how this variable relates to another variable
  - Rules for when or how the variable should be populated, or how the contents should be formatted
  - Examples of values that might appear in the variable. Such examples are only examples, and although they may be CDISC Controlled Terminology values, their presence in a CDISC Note should not be construed as definitive. For authoritative information on CDISC Controlled Terminology, consult https://www.cancer.gov/research/resources/terminology/cdisc.
- Core: Contains 1 of the 3 values—"Req", "Exp", or "Perm"—explained further in Section 4.1.5, SDTM Core Designations.

### 1.5 Known Issues

Derived Records and the use of --DRVFL

Although it is implicit in the general concept of a derived record that there is no collected result (--ORRES should be null), this is not an explicit requirement currently stated in published CDISC material. This is being evaluated for clarification in a future release of the SDTMIG and/or Model document.

Use of --LNKID and --LNKGRP

The definition of --LNKID says that it is "used to identify a record," and the definition of --LNKGRP says that it is "used to identify a group of records." This implies that when setting up a relationship in RELREC, a row where RELTYPE = ONE will have an IDVAR of --LNKID (and not --LNKGRP); a row where RELTYPE = MANY will have an IDVAR of --LNKID (and not --LNKGRP). The examples in this version of the SDTMIG have not been systematically reviewed to implement this distinction between --LNKID and --LNKGRP. This distinction between --LNKID and --LNKGRP, and the appropriateness of using other identification variables for linking, will be clarified in a future release of the SDTMIG and/or Model document, and at that time examples in the SDTMIG will be systematically reviewed and updated to reflect that clarification.
