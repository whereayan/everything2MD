## 2 Fundamentals of the SDTM

### 2.1 Observations and Variables

The SDTMIG for Human Clinical Trials is based on the SDTM’s general framework for organizing clinical trial information that is to be submitted to regulatory authorities. The SDTM is built around the concept of observations collected about subjects who participated in a clinical study. Each observation can be described by a series of variables, corresponding to a row in a dataset. Each variable can be classified according to its role. A role determines the type of information conveyed by the variable about each distinct observation and how it can be used. Variables can be classified into 5 major roles:

- Identifier variables, such as those that identify the study, subject, domain, and sequence number of the record
- Topic variables, which specify the focus of the observation (e.g., the name of a lab test)
- Timing variables, which describe the timing of the observation (e.g., start date and end date)
- Qualifier variables, which include additional illustrative text or numeric values that describe the results or additional traits of the observation (e.g., units, descriptive adjectives)
- Rule variables, which describe the condition to start, end, branch, or loop in the Trial Design Model

The set of Qualifier variables can be further categorized into 5 subclasses:

- Grouping Qualifiers are used to group together a collection of observations within the same domain. Examples include --CAT and --SCAT.
- Result Qualifiers describe the specific results associated with the topic variable in a Findings dataset. They answer the question raised by the topic variable. Result Qualifiers are --ORRES, --STRESC, and -- STRESN.
- Synonym Qualifiers specify an alternative name for a particular variable in an observation. Examples include ‑‑MODIFY and --DECOD, which are equivalent terms for a --TRT or --TERM topic variable, and --TEST and ‑‑LOINC, which are equivalent terms for a --TESTCD.
- Record Qualifiers define additional attributes of the observation record as a whole (rather than describing a particular variable within a record). Examples include --REASND, AESLIFE, and all other serious adverse event (SAE) flag variables in the AE domain; AGE, SEX, and RACE in the DM domain; and --BLFL, -- POS, --LOC, --SPEC and --NAM in a Findings domain
- Variable Qualifiers are used to further modify or describe a specific variable within an observation and are only meaningful in the context of the variable they qualify. Examples include --ORRESU, --ORNRHI, and ‑‑ORNRLO, all of which are Variable Qualifiers of --ORRES; and --DOSU, which is a Variable Qualifier of ‑‑DOSE.

For example, in the observation, "Subject 101 had mild nausea starting on study day 6," the Topic variable value is the term for the adverse event, "NAUSEA". The Identifier variable is the subject identifier, "101". The Timing variable is the study day of the start of the event, which captures the information, "starting on study day 6," whereas an example of a Record Qualifier is the severity, the value for which is "MILD". Additional Timing and Qualifier variables could be included to provide the necessary detail to adequately describe an observation.

### 2.2 Datasets and Domains

Observations about study subjects are normally collected for all subjects in a series of domains. A domain is defined as a collection of logically related observations with a common topic. The logic of the relationship may pertain to the scientific subject matter of the data or to its role in the trial. Each domain is represented by a single dataset.

Each domain dataset is distinguished by a unique, 2-character code that should be used consistently throughout the submission. This code, which is stored in the SDTM variable named DOMAIN, is used in 4 ways: as the dataset name, as the value of the DOMAIN variable in that dataset, as a prefix for most variable names in that dataset, and as a value in the RDOMAIN variable in relationship tables (see Section 8, Representing Relationships and Data).

All datasets are structured as flat files with rows representing observations and columns representing variables. Each dataset is described by metadata definitions that provide information about the variables used in the dataset. The metadata are described in a data definition document (i.e., a Define-XML document) that is submitted with the data to regulatory authorities. The Define-XML standard (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/data- exchange/define-xml) specifies metadata attributes to describe SDTM data.

Data represented in SDTM datasets include data as originally collected or received, data from the protocol, assigned data, and derived data. The SDTM lists only the name, label, and type, with a set of brief CDISC guidelines that provide a general description for each variable.

The domain dataset models in Section 5, Models for Special-purpose Domains, and Section 6, Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes, provide additional information about controlled terms or format, notes on proper usage, and examples. See also Section 1.4.1, How to Read a Domain Specification.

### 2.3 The General Observation Classes

Most subject-level observations collected during the study should be represented according to 1 of the 3 SDTM general observation classes: Interventions, Events, or Findings. The lists of variables allowed to be used in each of these can be found in the SDTM.

- The Interventions class captures investigational, therapeutic, and other treatments that are administered to the subject (with some actual or expected physiological effect) either as specified by the study protocol (e.g., exposure to study drug), coincident with the study assessment period (e.g., concomitant medications), or self‑administered by the subject (e.g., use of alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine).
- The Events class captures planned protocol milestones such as randomization and study completion, and occurrences, conditions, or incidents independent of planned study evaluations occurring during the trial (e.g., adverse events) or prior to the trial (e.g., medical history).
- The Findings class captures the observations resulting from planned evaluations to address specific tests or questions (e.g., laboratory tests, ECG testing, questions listed on questionnaires).

In most cases, the choice of observation class appropriate to a specific collection of data can be easily determined according to these descriptions. The majority of data, which typically consists of measurements or responses to questions, usually at specific visits or time points, will fit the Findings general observation class. Additional guidance on choosing the appropriate general observation class is provided in Section 8.6.1, Guidelines for Determining the General Observation Class.

General assumptions for use with all domain models and custom domains based on the general observation classes are described in Section 4, Assumptions for Domain Models; specific assumptions for individual domains are included with the domain models.

### 2.4 Datasets Other than General Observation Class Domains

The SDTM includes 4 types of datasets other than those based on the general observation classes:

- Domain datasets with subject-level data that do not conform to 1 of the 3 general observation classes. These include Demographics (DM), Comments (CO), Subject Elements (SE), and Subject Visits (SV), and are described in Section 5, Models for Special-purpose Domains.
- Trial Design Model (TDM) datasets, which represent information about the study design but do not contain subject data. These include datasets such as Trial Arms (TA) and Trial Elements (TE) and are described in Section 7, Trial Design Model Datasets.
- Relationship datasets, such as the RELREC and SUPP-- datasets. These are described in Section 8, Representing Relationships and Data.
- Study Reference datasets include Device Identifiers (DI) and Non-host Organism Identifiers (OI). These provide structures for representing study-specific terminology used in subject data. These are described in Section 9, Study References.

### 2.5 The SDTM Standard Domain Models

A sponsor should only submit domain datasets that were actually collected (or directly derived from the collected data) for a given study. Decisions on what data to collect should be based on the scientific objectives of the study, rather than the SDTM. Note that any data collected that will be submitted in an analysis (ADaM) dataset must be traceable to a source in a tabulation (SDTM) dataset.

The collected data for a given study may use standard domains from this and other SDTM implementation guides as well as additional custom domains based on the 3 general observation classes. A list of standard domains is provided in Section 3.2.1, Dataset-level Metadata. Final domains will be published only in an SDTM implementation guide (this guide or another implementation guide, e.g., SDTMIG for Medical Devices). Therapeutic-area standards projects and other projects may develop proposals for additional domains. Draft versions of these domains may be made available in the CDISC wiki in the SDTM Draft Domains space (https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/SDD/SDTM+Draft+Domains+Home).

These general rules apply when determining which variables to include in a domain:

- The Identifier variables, STUDYID, USUBJID, DOMAIN, and --SEQ are required in all domains based on the general observation classes. Other Identifiers may be added as needed.
- Any Timing variables are permissible for use in any submission dataset based on a general observation class except where restricted by specific domain assumptions.
- Any additional Qualifier variables from the same general observation class may be added to a domain model except where restricted by specific domain assumptions.
- Sponsors may not add any variables other than those described in the preceding 3 bullets. The SDTM allows for the inclusion of a sponsor's non-SDTM variables using the Supplemental Qualifiers special- purpose dataset structure, described in Section 8.4, Relating Non-standard Variable Values to a Parent Domain. As the SDTM continues to evolve, certain additional standard variables may be added to the general observation classes.
- Standard variables must not be renamed or modified for novel usage. Their metadata should not be changed.
- A Permissible variable should be used in an SDTM dataset wherever appropriate.

  - If a study includes a data item that would be represented in a Permissible variable, then that variable must be included in the SDTM dataset, even if null. Refer to the Define-XML standard (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/data-exchange/define-xml) for additional details on how to manage no data availability.
  - If a study did not include a data item that would be represented in a Permissible variable, then that variable should not be included in the SDTM dataset and should not be declared in the Define-XML document.

### 2.6 Creating a New Domain

This section describes the overall process for creating a custom domain, which must be based on 1 of the 3 SDTM general observation classes. The number of domains submitted should be based on the specific requirements of the study. To create a custom domain,

1. Confirm that none of the existing published domains will fit the need. A custom domain may only be

created if the data are different in nature and do not fit into an existing published domain.

    - Establish a domain of a common topic; that is, where the nature of the data is the same rather than by a specific method of collection (e.g., electrocardiogram). Group and separate data within the domain using --CAT, --SCAT, --METHOD, --SPEC, --LOC, and so on, as appropriate. Examples of different

topics are: microbiology, tumor measurements, pathology/histology, vital signs, and physical exam results.

    - Do not create separate domains based on time; rather, represent both prior and current observations in a domain (e.g., CM for all non-study medications). Note that Adverse Events (AE) and Medical History (MH) are an exception to this best practice because of regulatory reporting needs.

    - How collected data are used (e.g., to support analyses and/or efficacy endpoints) must not result in the creation of a custom domain. For example, if blood pressure measurements are endpoints in a hypertension study, they must still be represented in the Vital Signs (VS) domain, as opposed to a custom “efficacy” domain. Similarly, if liver function test results are of special interest, they must still be represented in the Laboratory Tests (LB) domain.

    - Data that were collected on separate CRF modules or pages may fit into an existing domain (e.g., as separate questionnaires into the QS domain, prior and concomitant medications in the CM domain).

    - If it is necessary to represent relationships between data that are hierarchical in nature (e.g., a parent record must be observed before child records), then establish a domain pair (e.g., MB/MS, PC/PP). Note: Domain pairs have been modeled for microbiology data (MB/MS domains) and pharmacokinetics (PK) data (PC/PP domains) to enable dataset-level relationships to be described using RELREC. The domain pair uses DOMAIN as an identifier to group parent records (e.g., MB) from child records (e.g., MS) and enables a dataset-level relationship to be described in RELREC. Without using DOMAIN to facilitate description of the data relationships, RELREC, as currently defined, could not be used without introducing a variable that would group data like DOMAIN.

2. Check the SDTM Draft Domains area of the CDISC wiki

(https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/SDD/SDTM+Draft+Domains+Home) for proposed domains developed since the last published version of the SDTMIG. These proposed domains may be used as custom domains in a submission.

3. Look for an existing, relevant domain model to serve as a prototype. If no existing model seems

appropriate, choose the general observation class (Interventions, Events, or Findings) that best fits the data by considering the topic of the observation. As illustrated in the following figure, the general approach for selecting variables for a custom domain is:

a. Select and include the required identifier variables (e.g., STUDYID, DOMAIN, USUBJID, --SEQ) and any permissible Identifier variables from the SDTM.

b. Include the topic variable from the identified general observation class (e.g., --TESTCD for Findings)

in the SDTM.

c. Select and include the relevant qualifier variables from the identified general observation class in the SDTM. Variables belonging to other general observation classes must not be added.

d. Select and include the applicable timing variables in the SDTM.

e. Determine the domain code, one that is not a domain code in the CDISC Controlled Terminology SDTM Domain Abbreviations codelist (see https://datascience.cancer.gov/resources/cancer- vocabulary/cdisc-terminology). If it is desired to have this domain code be part of CDISC Controlled Terminology, submit a request at https://ncitermform.nci.nih.gov/ncitermform/?version=cdisc. The sponsor-selected, 2‑character domain code should be used consistently throughout the submission. AD, AX, AP, SQ, and SA may not be used as custom domain codes.

f. Apply the 2-character domain code to the appropriate variables in the domain. Replace all variable prefixes (shown in the models as “--“) with the domain code.

g. Set the order of variables consistent with the order defined in the SDTM for the general observation

class.

h. Adjust the labels of the variables only as appropriate to properly convey the meaning in the context of

the data being submitted in the newly created domain. Use title case for all labels (title case means to capitalize the first letter of every word except for articles, prepositions, and conjunctions).

i. Ensure that appropriate standard variables are being properly applied by comparing their use in the custom domain to their use in standard domains.

j. Describe the dataset within the Define-XML document. See Section 3.2, Using the CDISC Domain Models in Regulatory Submissions — Dataset Metadata.

k. Place any non-standard (SDTM) variables in a Supplemental Qualifier dataset. Mechanisms for

representing additional non-standard qualifier variables not described in the general observation classes and for defining relationships between separate datasets or records are described in Section 8.4, Relating Non-standard Variable Values to a Parent Domain.

### 2.7 SDTM Variables Not Allowed in the SDTMIG

This section identifies those SDTM variables that either (1) should not be used in SDTM-compliant data tabulations of clinical trials data or (2) have not yet been evaluated for use in human clinical trials.

The following SDTM variables, defined for use in nonclinical studies (SEND), must NEVER be used in the submission of SDTM-based data for human clinical trials:

- --USCHFL (Interventions, Events, Findings)
- --METHOD (Interventions)
- --RSTIND (Interventions, Findings)
- --RSTMOD (Interventions, Findings)
- --IMPLBL (Findings)
- --RESLOC (Findings)
- --DTHREL (Findings)
- --EXCLFL (Findings)
- --REASEX (Findings)
- FETUSID (Identifiers)
- RPHASE (Timing Variables)
- RPPLDY (Timing Variables)
- RPPLSTDY (Timing Variables)
- RPPLENDY (Timing Variables)
- --NOMDY (Timing Variables)
- --NOMLBL (Timing Variables)
- --RPDY (Timing Variables)
- --RPSTDY (Timing Variables)
- --RPENDY (Timing Variables)
- --DETECT (Timing Variables)

The following variables can be used for nonclinical studies (SEND) but must NEVER be used in the Demographics (DM) domain for human clinical trials, where all subjects are human. See Section 9.2, Non-host Organism Identifiers, for information about representing taxonomic information for non-host organisms such as bacteria and viruses.

- SPECIES (Demographics)
- STRAIN (Demographics)
- SBSTRAIN (Demographics)
- RPATHCD (Demographics)

The following variables have not been evaluated for use in human clinical trials and must therefore be used with extreme caution:

- --ANTREG (Findings)
- --CHRON (Findings)
- --DISTR (Findings)
- SETCD (Demographics)

The use of SETCD additionally requires the use of the Trials Sets domain.

The following identifier variable can be used for nonclinical studies (SEND), and may be used in human clinical trials when appropriate:

- POOLID

The use of POOLID additionally requires the use of the Pool Definition dataset.

Other variables defined in the SDTM are allowed for use as defined in this SDTMIG except when explicitly stated. Custom domains, created following the guidance in Section 2.6, Creating a New Domain, may utilize any appropriate qualifier variables from the selected general observation class.
